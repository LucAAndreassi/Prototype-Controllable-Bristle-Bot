# Prototype-Controllable-Bristle-Bot
## Overview
With influence from the popular toy HexBug, I designed a similar style bot that can be steered with a joystick.
### How It Moves
The bristles are angled away from the direction of motion so that when they vibrate they effectively push the ground back and move the bot forward. In order to accomplish the steering function, one side is given more power than the other. This causes that side to move faster and turn the bot accordingly. Since the bristles have to be angled opposite the direction of motion, the bot is not capable of going backwards.
